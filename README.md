# 06-3D-RPG

A 3D RPG Game created in Godot 3.5

Based on some of the [Kenney Character Assets](https://www.kenney.nl/) provided by kenney.nl. The model and animations were compiled in Blender and then imported into Godot.

## Implementation

Created in Blender 3.5 and Godot 3.5

- Added original background track
- Completes basic requirements


## Future Development
-  Fix bug in which ship does not properly damage the Player
-  Fix bug in which prompt for dialogue starts at beginning of play instead of when reaching NPC area (if you walk in and out of the player area, it fixes)
